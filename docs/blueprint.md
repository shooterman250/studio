# **App Name**: Interactive Design Room Designer

## Core Features:

- Visual Hierarchy & Layout: Implement a cleaner card-based design with consistent spacing and rounded corners. Use a more organized grid system (2-3 columns depending on screen size). Add subtle shadows and transitions for depth. Keep the existing color palette (#99847A background with glass-card effects)
- Navigation Improvements: Create a persistent sidebar/breadcrumb navigation. Add visual indicators for completion status (progress bars/circles). Implement a more intuitive back/forward flow
- Selection Interface: Redesign option cards to be more visual (larger preview images). Add clear selection states with the existing green checkmark. Group related options more logically
- Content Organization: Better categorize the room customization options. Add collapsible sections for complex categories. Include helpful tooltips or info icons for unclear terms
- Technical Improvements: Optimize the component structure (extract repeated elements). Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout. Consider using a state management solution for complex selections
- Visual Elements to Preserve: Maintain the leopard print overlay aesthetic. Keep the glass-card effect with blur. Retain the earthy color palette (#99847A background). Preserve the butterfly logo branding
- Additional Features: Add a 'favorites' system for options. Include a comparison view for similar options. Implement a summary/preview mode before PDF export

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary background color: Earthy tone (#99847A) to maintain brand identity.
- Glass-card effect with blur to create a modern, visually appealing interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights, providing contrast against the earthy background.
- Implement a 2-3 column grid system for responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Persistent sidebar navigation to allow visual completion status
- Butterfly logo branding for site and pdf generation.
